# Discord-Daily-Topic
Demo of a Python Discord Bot for triggering daily discussions on selected topics

##### Requirements:
```sh
pip install discord
```
```sh
pip install asyncio
```

# How to start
First you have to customize your topics list, called **question_list** and then replace **your_bot_token** with your DISCORD BOT TOKEN. <br />

*You can also configure the title, the thumbnail image and the delay between topics ( this example uses a wikipedia generic image and the Daily Topic title).* <br />
